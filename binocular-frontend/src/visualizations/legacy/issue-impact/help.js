    <h1 className="title">Issue Impact Help</h1>
    <p>
      This visualization aims to show the development "impact" caused by a specific issue in your ITS. Select an issue from the sidebar to
      begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horizontal axis in the middle of the circle represents the lifetime of the selected issue. It begins with its creation and ends
      when it is closed (or the current date if the issue is still open).
    </p>
    <h2>Upper semicircle: Files</h2>
    <p>
      The upper semicircle shows all files touched by commits referencing the selected issue. The length of the individual file-axes is
      determined by the maximum total length each file had in its lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each file-axis is connected to the central time-axis by commits which are represented by a collection of circle segments connecting
      the relevant hunks of the file that were changed on the file's axis to the point in time that the commit was made on the time-axis.
    </p>
    <p>Hunks belonging to the same commit share the same color.</p>
    <h2>Lower semicircle: Builds</h2>
    <p>
      On the lower semicircle axis of the visualization, CI builds are charted according to their run-lengths. Each build is segmented into
      its phases and color coded based on its status.
    </p>
    <h2>Sidebar</h2>
    <p>Use the search-box to choose an issue to visualize. When an issue is selected, more options become available.</p>
    <p>
      <h3>Filters</h3>
      <p>Use the provided filter boxes to exclude certain files or commits from the visualization in order to de-clutter the chart.</p>
    </p>
