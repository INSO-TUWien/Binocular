      This chart depicts different data points which can be used to assess which developer has the most expertise for a certain issue or
      module of the project. The chart shows:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i className="fa fa-plus" /> Added Code
          <ul>
            <li>The size of a segment depicts the amount of code a developer has added relative to the other stakeholders</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i className="fa fa-check" /> Owned Code
          <ul>
            <li>The middle section of each segment is split</li>
            <li>The coloured part represents the amount of code the developer currently owns for the selected configuration</li>
            <li>
              The hashed part represents the amount of code the developer added to the project, but that was deleted or replaced later on
            </li>
            <li>The section therefore shows how much of the added code is still present in the project</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i class="fa fa-clipboard-list"></i> Good and Bad Commits
          <ul>
            <li>
              The size of the green arc outside the circle segment represents the amount of good commits, which are commits that
              successfully passed the CI-Pipeline
            </li>
            <li>
              The size of the red arc inside the circle segment represents the amount of bad commits, which are commits that did not pass
              the CI-Pipeline successfully
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The inner dotted part of a segment depicts the number of commits relative to the other stakeholders for the current selection
            </li>
