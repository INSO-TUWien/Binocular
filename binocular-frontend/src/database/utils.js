// Returns an array of commit hashes that represent the history of this commit.
// Array is in reverse order, starting with the sha of the commit in question.
// History is calculated by following the parent commits back to the genesis commit of the project.
// every element of allCommits must have the `sha`, `date` and `parents` attributes.
// Note: We can't rely on the fact that parent commits have a `date` <= the `date` commit in question
//  (see e.g. https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/314761/github-parent-commit-committed-after-child-commit)
//  So it is not enough that `allCommits` contains all commits with date <= the date of the commit in question.
//  To be safe, `allCommits` should really contain all commits of the project.
//  Otherwise, this function may return wrong results (if there are commits in the history that have a `date` > the `commit` date).
